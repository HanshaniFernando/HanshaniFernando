Welcome to my portfolio! 
I'm Hanshani Fernando, and this project showcases my journey, skills, and experiences. 
As an enthusiast in web development, I've crafted this portfolio using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, blending the knowledge I've gained from multimedia lessons, YouTube tutorials, and interactions with ChatGPT. 
Here, you'll find insights about me, my skill set, and the various experiences I've accumulated. 
Additionally, I've provided links to my YouTube channel where I share insights and tutorials, as well as past web pages I've created. 
Feel free to explore, and don't hesitate to reach out to me via the contact information provided, including my CV for further details.
